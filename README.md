For grading reference:
- Release notes are generated via GitHub and are not stored in the "Milestone Submissions" folder.
- Weekly Lab write-ups (if applicable) will be found in that "Milestone Submissions" folder
- Our project board is divided into week-long sprints. Inside each sprint are a list of issues (User stories), and those issues are categorized via milestones (Epics). To view said epics, please navigate to our Repo --> Issues --> Milestones (next to the "New Issue" button)
- Weekly meeting notes are stored in the "Team Meeting Logs" folder

# 💡 The Idea

Have you ever walked into The Rec and realized it's more packed than a can of sardines? If only there was a way to predict and plan ahead to prevent the dreaded Rec Center rush hours...

Introducing Buff Traffic, an app to track current and historic traffic trends at The Rec so you can spend more time working out and less time awkwardly waiting on the side for your turn.

# 🦬 The Execution

- Front-end design is created using the help of the Bootstrap library
- All of our logos and visual assets are hand-drawn (Thanks @LillyCS !)
- This app uses NodeJS to make API calls
- We call from CU Boulder's regularly updated database to display current and historic headcount data at The Rec.
- We host our own database using PostgreSQL
